### Making APIs So Easy, Even Your Dog 🐶 Could Do It
Instant CRUD with authentication and real-time MongoDB, all from a single file.

- 🔄 **Real-time Sync** — Socket.IO support with automatic data change events
- 🔧 **Permission System** — Define access per operation, per permission
- 🧠 **Schema-first Design** — Write once in `config.json`, generate the rest
